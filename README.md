# 🐶 HungryDog - A 2D Unity Game  

## 🎮 About the Game  
**HungryDog** is a simple 2D game developed while learning Unity. In this game, hungry dogs appear from one side of the screen, and the player must throw steaks at them to feed them and make them go home (disappear from the scene).  

### 🕹️ Gameplay  
- **Objective**: Feed the hungry dogs by throwing steaks at them.  
- **Controls**: Move within the bounds and use spacebar to throw steaks to satisfy the dogs.  
- **Game Features**:  
  - Three different dog types, each with varying speeds.  
  - You **can't spam steaks**—strategy matters!  
  - The player is restricted within the game bounds.  
  - No losing condition (for now 😉) — just keep feeding the dogs!
